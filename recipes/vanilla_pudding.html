	<p>This is the easiest vanilla pudding recipe-it doesn't even<br> require you to temper egg yolks!</p>
	<h4>Ingredients (5 to 10 servings)</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>1 vanilla bean</li>
		<li>2/3 cup sugar</li>
		<li>3 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
		<li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
		<li>3 cups whole milk</li>
		<li>2 tablespoons (28g) European unsalted butter, such as Plugra</li>
		<li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Some optional toppings</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Crushed graham crackers</li>
		<li>Sliced strawberries</li>
		<li>Raspberries</li>
		<li>Blackberries</li>
		<li>Sliced bananas</li>
		<li>Whipped cream</li>
		<li>Chocolate shavings</li>
		<li>Flaky sea salt</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>How to prepare</h4>
	<ol>
		<li><p><strong>Set up strainer:</strong><br> Set a fine mesh strainer over a medium heat-proof bowl. You'll need <br> it to strain the pudding.</p></li>
		<li><p><strong>Cut the vanilla pod:</strong><br> Use a sharp paring knife to cut the vanilla bean pod in half<br> lengthwise. Use the back of the knife to scrape the seeds into a<br> medium (4-quart) saucepan. Add the pod in there too.</p></li>
		<li><p><strong>Add the remaining ingredients:</strong><br> Add the sugar, cornstarch, and salt and whisk until combined. Add<br> the milk and continue whisking until the dry ingredients are fully<br> dissolved. Then, add the butter.</p></li>
		<li><p><strong>Slowly bring to a boil:</strong><br> Set the saucepan over medium-low heat. Continue to whisk slowly,<br> ensuring that the whisk reaches the edges of the pot. As the mixture<br> warms, the butter will melt but not be completely incorporated. The<br> mixture will first thicken to look like heavy cream. Then, it will steam<br> and bubbles will appear around the edges. This will take 15 to 20<br> minutes. Do not increase the heat and rush the processâ€”the<br> pudding will become gritty or the cornstarch may overcook and get clumpy.</p></li>
		<li><p><strong>Boil the pudding:</strong><br> As soon as you see bigger bubbles appear in the center of the<br> saucepan, set a 1-minute timer and continue to whisk gently. After 1<br> minute, remove the saucepan from the heat. The pudding will be<br> pourable and the texture will be similar to unstrained yogurt.</p></li>
		<li><p><strong>Strain and add vanilla extract:</strong><br> Pour the pudding through the prepared strainer. Use a rubber<br> spatula to scrape all the pudding out of the pot and through the<br> strainer. Discard the vanilla pod.</p><p>Stir the vanilla extract into the pudding. Cover it with plastic wrap,<br> making sure the wrap is pressed against the surface of the pudding<br> and refrigerate until chilled, about 2 hours.</p></li>
		<li><p><strong>Ready to serve!</strong><br> Remove the pudding from the refrigerator and discard the plastic<br> wrap. Stir the pudding and scoop into small bowls.</p><p>You can add toppings-such as the ones listed above.<br> Transfer leftovers into an airtight container and refrigerate. Stir well<br> before serving to help loosen the pudding. It lasts for up to 5 days in<br> the refrigerator, and up to 2 months in the freezer.</p></li>
